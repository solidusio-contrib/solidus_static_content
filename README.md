# Solidus Static Content

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/solidusio-contrib/solidus_static_content.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/solidusio-contrib/solidus_static_content)

A fork of the [Spree extension](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_static_content) for
compatibility with [Solidus](https://solidus.io).

Good, clean content management of pages for Solidus. You can use it to:

- Add and manage static pages such as an About page.
- Show a static page instead of existing dynamic pages such as the home page, products pages, and
  taxon pages.

## Installation

Add solidus_static_content to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_static_content'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_static_content:install
```

## Usage

Using the 'Pages' option in the admin tab, you can add static pages to your Solidus store. The page
content can be pulled directly from the database, be a separate layout file or be rendered as a
partial.

In the admin tab, use the 'New page' option to create a new static page.

The title, slug, body, and meta fields will replace their respective page elements on load. The
title, slug and body element are all required fields.

Body text provided without a layout/partial being specified will be loaded in the
`spree_application` layout after it is pulled from the database.

### Layout and partial rendering

To render an entire page without the `spree_application` layout, specify a relative path to the
layout file (e.g. `spree/layouts/layout_file_name`). Note that the name of this file will not be
prefixed with an underscore as it is a layout, not a partial.

To render a partial, specify the path in the layout file name and check the 'Render layout as
partial' option. The path specified in the layout area will not have an underscore, but it will be
required in the filename.

Also note the availability of the `render_snippet` helper which finds a page by its slug and renders
the raw page body anywhere in your view.

### Options

Use the 'Show in' checkboxes to specify whether to display the page links in the header, footer or
sidebar. The position setting alters the order in which they appear.

Finally, toggle the visibility using the 'Visible' checkbox. If it is unchecked, the page will not
be available.

## Development

### Testing the extension

First bundle your dependencies, then run `bin/rake`. `bin/rake` will default to building the dummy
app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using
`bin/rake extension:test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bin/rake
```

To run [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis run

```shell
bundle exec rubocop
```

When testing your application's integration with this extension you may use its factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_static_content/factories'
```

### Running the sandbox

To run this extension in a sandboxed Solidus application, you can run `bin/sandbox`. The path for
the sandbox app is `./sandbox` and `bin/rails` will forward any Rails commands to
`sandbox/bin/rails`.

Here's an example:

```shell
$ bin/rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 6.0.2.1 application starting in development
* Listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

### Releasing new versions

Your new extension version can be released using `gem-release` like this:

```shell
bundle exec gem bump -v VERSION --tag --push --remote upstream && gem release
```
